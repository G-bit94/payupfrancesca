                    and
                    shameless exploitation of people she's hired before. I'm on a mission to let the whole world
                    know
                    what a despicable and vile person she is
                    as this is the only way to get retribution when exploited by such a remorseless and malicious
                    person. I believe sharing my experience
                    will help others steer clear of Francesca and people like her.</p>

                        Howdy! I'm Kelvin, a hard worker who takes pride in what I do and believes in doing the
                        right
                        thing in all my dealings. As a freelancer, I've always gone the extra mile to deliver
                        top-notch
                        work to my clients, putting in my best efforts and dedicating my time to make sure they're
                        happy
                        with the results. I'm all about open communication, transparency, and mutual respect when it
                        comes to professional relationships.<br><br>

                        While on the hunt for freelance gigs, I stumbled upon a subreddit called r/SlaveLabour,
                        where I
                        connected with Francesca. Little did I know that she would take the name of the subreddit
                        way
                        too seriously (and literally), turning our professional partnership into a total nightmare.
                        Even
                        though I held
                        up my end of the bargain and put in three months of my time and energy, I've been left high
                        and
                        dry, without a dime to show for my hard work.<br><br>

                        As someone who values hard work and fairness, it's really messed up to find myself in this
                        situation. I've bent over backwards trying to sort things out with Francesca, reaching out
                        to
                        her time and time again over the past year, only to be met with complete radio silence and
                        indifference. The total lack of communication and unwillingness to address the situation has
                        left me feeling frustrated, disrespected, and totally taken advantage of.

                        Francesca.
                        Francesca presented herself online as a savvy businesswoman with various entrepreneurial

                        one of deception and exploitation.

                        <p>I stumbled upon this subreddit called r/SlaveLabour in April 2022,
                            a
                            subreddit where people post all kinds of gigs they need help with, while hunting for
                            freelance work. It was there that I first encountered Francesca. I had posted an ad of
                            sorts
                            saying that I was ready to take up any "techie" gigs that aligned with my skills and
                            experience. I was
                            was for work as a web dev, content writer/editor, SEO, social media manager, graphic
                            designer... anything to help
                            me stay afloat. Francesca happened to be among the people who reached out following the
                            listing and
                            eager to take on put something on the table, I quickly accepted her offer of work. I
                            remember being elated that my days of strife and anguish were soon to be over.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>After some brief chat on Reddit and later WhatsApp, Francesca and I agreed upon the scope
                            of
                            work, timeline, and compensation for the different projects I'd be undertaking. I was to
                            dedicate three months of my time to complete the tasks assigned to me, and in return,
                            Francesca committed to providing fair remuneration for my efforts. With the terms
                            clearly outlined and both parties in agreement,
                            I enthusiastically began working on Yupvoted, her first project.</p>
                        <h2>The Work</h2>
                        <p>Throughout the three months, I poured my heart and soul into the work, ensuring that
                            every
                            aspect was handled with meticulous care. I regularly communicated
                            with Francesca, providing updates on my progress and seeking any necessary
                            clarifications or
                            feedback. Francesca seemed satisfied with my work, and I had no reason to suspect that
                            anything was amiss.</p>

                        <p>However, as the work (Yupvoted alongside a few other projects I'd picked up
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQ06jl0EMYZbuKCtz_DdFZeL9ctnso3cpjJwuPZpXnI/view">
                                as my Timesheet shows</a>) drew to a close and payment time approached, Francesca's
                            demeanor
                            shifted in a troubling way. Suddenly, getting hold of her turned into a frustrating game
                            of
                            hide-and-seek. Whenever I brought up the money I was owed, I was met with either vague,
                            evasive responses or deafening silence. I tried to remain patient and understanding,
                            giving
                            Francesca the benefit of the doubt and ample time to resolve the issue.

                        <h3>The Betrayal</h3>
                        <p>Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months as I found myself living on a prayer,
                            desperately clinging to the hope that Francesca would finally come through. Needless to
                            say,
                            the payment never materialized. I continued to reach out to Francesca, politely
                            reminding
                            her of our agreement and requesting an update on when I could expect to receive my
                            compensation. My emails were met with deafening silence, and it became increasingly
                            apparent
                            that Francesca had no intention of honoring her end of the bargain.</p>
                        <p>The radio silence and total disregard for my efforts left me feeling betrayed and taken
                            for a
                            ride.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Francesca's communication became sporadic</li>
                            <li>Payment never materialized despite multiple follow-ups</li>
                            <li>Francesca displayed no intention of honoring the agreement</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As the months passed, my frustration and disappointment grew. I had dedicated a
                            significant
                            portion of my time and energy to the project, trusting that Francesca would uphold her
                            commitment to fair compensation.</p>

                            expressing my
                            frustration and demanding resolution. </p>

                            stipulated an expectation of receiving full or partial compensation by that date.</p>
                        <p>And just like Francesca, Stephanie's communication abruptly ceased, leaving me in the
                            lurch

                        <p>In a last-ditch attempt to get things sorted out, I finally decided to reach out to

                            Francesca's husband, hoping he might intervene and help mediate the situation. I

                            the entire ordeal to him, emphasizing the hardship and frustration I had endured due to
                            the
                            unpaid work.</p>

                        <p>As I continue waiting for a response from Colin, 5 months now and counting, I can't help
                            but
                            reflect on the emotional toll this experience has taken on me. The sense of betrayal and
                            disrespect is overwhelming, and the financial strain has been a constant source of
                            stress. I
                            remain determined to pursue every avenue available to me, including legal action if

                        <p>It has now been nearly 1.5 years since the completion of the project, and I am still
                            waiting
                            for the payment that I rightfully earned. The financial impact of this scam has been
                            significant, as I had relied on the promised compensation to cover my living expenses
                            and
                            invest in my freelance career. She especially had me living on a prayer for the first 3
                            months.</p>
                        <p>Looking back, it's plain as day that Francesca's intentions were never to engage in a
                            fair
                            and professional collaboration. Instead, she exploited the trust and goodwill of
                            freelancers
                            like myself, taking advantage of the platform provided by r/SlaveLabour to lure
                            unsuspecting
                            individuals into her web of deceit.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p>"The name of the subreddit seems to have been taken too literally by Francesca, as
                                she
                                treated me as nothing more than a slave, expecting work without any intention of
                                providing rightful compensation."</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This whole experience has been a rude awakening to the risks and challenges freelancers
                            face
                            in the digital age. It just goes to show how important it is to do your homework, get
                            everything in writing, and make sure platforms have safeguards in place to protect
                            freelancers from getting scammed and exploited.</p>
                        <p>As I continue to navigate this difficult situation, I remain determined to seek justice
                            and
                            hold Francesca accountable for her actions. I have explored various avenues, including
                            reaching out to Francesca's husband, Colin, in the hope that he may intervene and help
                            mediate a resolution. However, I am also prepared to take legal action if necessary, to
                            ensure that my rights are protected and that I receive the compensation I am owed.</p>
